# Database Configuration - Teleinformatics Core API
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values
# Make sure to keep the .env file secure and do not commit it to version control, as it contains sensitive information. (Add .env to your .gitignore file)
# ==========================================
# MySQL database host
DB_HOST=host

# The port where MySQL is running (Default is 3306)
DB_PORT=3306

# The name of your MySQL database
MYSQL_DB_NAME=db_name

# Your MySQL database username
MYSQL_USER=user

# Your MySQL database password
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password

# ==========================================
# Security Configuration (JWT)
# Make sure to change the JWT_SECRET to a secure random string in production. It should be at least 32 characters long for security reasons.
# The JWT_SECRET is used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication. If an attacker gains access to this secret, they can forge valid tokens, so it is crucial to keep it secure and not share it publicly.
# Important: Should be the same as the JWT_SECRET used in the Teleinformatics Core API to ensure that tokens generated by the API can be verified correctly by the authentication middleware.
# ==========================================

# Token expiration time in milliseconds
# Examples: 
# 3600000 = 1 hour
# 8640000 = 2.4 hours
# 86400000 = 24 hours
